            <p> We are fortunate to have a team of trained Sommeliers who love food, and educated Chefs that love wine who spend most of their day sitting around the table talking about you.</p>
            <p> That's right, helping you get the most out of your meals is their top priority.</p>
            <p> It's why they spend so much time tasting and testing bottles of wine and huge servings of food all day long, so you will be able to celebrate with every meal.</p>
            <p> Are they dedicated? Sure.  Are they avoiding their families? Probably. Are they too full to move anywhere? Definitely.
            <p> It's a tough job.  Someone's got to do it.</p>
